I am a CTVA major and Computer Science minor at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2026.

##  Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 4
This lab was fun because we got to work with doubles in more depth. Doubles and int differences have always fascinated me since learning about them in our readings and lecture sessions. I felt like this lab really helped me grasp the difference and purpose between double and int parameters and data types. Double show the number in decimal for while and int maintain the whole number. 

Lab 5
On top of the reason for simply enjoying our use of if statements because before I wasn’t entirely familiarized with how it worked. I enjoyed this lab because it was challenging to my knowledge, causing me to learn more. During this lab we had to use a bit of math and I am someone who is not the best at math and I feel like it allowed me to exercise my ability and skills in problem solving so that our program could run efficiently. Now after doing this lab I understand the purpose of math within coding and also how an if statement functions. How we need to create the condition within the parentheses and have the source of the code within the block for the if statement to work.

Lab 11
I enjoyed this lab because of the complexity in its simplicity. My partner and I struggled a bit initially, not understanding how exactly we were supposed to use a member initialization list because we weren’t sure what the members were. But now, after completing this lab, I understand that the members were the non-static data members of the class and we declare them by using a colon “:” and initialize the data member with the value from the parameter.
